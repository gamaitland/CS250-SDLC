# CS250-SDLC
Portfolio for Software Development Lifecycle course

* How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
    * User needs are interpreted by taking what the most important parts of the user experience such as simplicity, clarity, and functionality and marrying them together in one bundle that is easy to use. User stories help with this interpretation because developers hear exactly what end users want without leaving anything to interpretation. To miss the mark on key features of a product due to insufficient use of user stories only makes for a bad customer journey. 
* How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
    * I approach developing programs by outlining what is necessary for the program on a surface level and then breaking each item down into ways it can be achieved. I hope to incorporate agile processes such as Scrumban in my future work because the workflow of Scrum and the organization of Kanban boards seem like an efficient union.
* What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
    * To be a good team member means to prioritize open communication and respect primarily. Collaboration and a team mentality follow close behind. The ability to not only give help, but ask for help is important. Soft skills such as that are what make a team successful. Solely depending on hard skills is futile if the team cannot sit in a meeting together.
